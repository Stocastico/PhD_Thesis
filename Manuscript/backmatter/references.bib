abstract={Augmented Reality in education can support students in a wide range of cognitive tasks--fostering understanding, remembering, applying, analysing, evaluating, and creating learning-relevant information more easily. It can help keep up engagement, and it can render learning more fun. Within the framework of a multi-year investigation encompassing primary and secondary schools across Europe, the ARETE project developed several Augmented Reality applications, providing tools for user interaction and data collection in the education sector. The project developed innovative AR learning technology and methodology, validating these in four comprehensive pilot studies, in total involving more than 2,900 students and teachers. Each pilot made use of a different Augmented Reality application covering specific subjects (English literacy skills, Mathematics and Geography, Positive Behaviour, plus, additionally, an Augmented Reality authoring tool applied in a wide range of subjects). In this paper, we introduce the datasets collected during the pilots, describe how the data enabled the validation of the technology, and how the approach chosen could enhance existing augmented reality applications in data exploration and modelling.},

abstract = {There are emerging concerns about the Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics (FATE) of educational interventions supported by the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. One of the emerging methods for increasing trust in AI systems is to use eXplainable AI (XAI), which promotes the use of methods that produce transparent explanations and reasons for decisions AI systems make. Considering the existing literature on XAI, this paper argues that XAI in education has commonalities with the broader use of AI but also has distinctive needs. Accordingly, we first present a framework, referred to as XAI-ED, that considers six key aspects in relation to explainability for studying, designing and developing educational AI tools. These key aspects focus on the stakeholders, benefits, approaches for presenting explanations, widely used classes of AI models, human-centred designs of the AI interfaces and potential pitfalls of providing explanations within education. We then present four comprehensive case studies that illustrate the application of XAI-ED in four different educational AI tools. The paper concludes by discussing opportunities, challenges and future research needs for the effective incorporation of XAI in education.}

abstract = {Existing literature reflects the multiple benefits of the integration of Augmented Reality (AR) technologies in educational settings. Many studies have been conducted to establish the tendencies, affordances, and challenges of this technology for education. However, most of these studies are qualitative studies that do not measure the extent of the impact of this technology on education. This study conducted a meta-analysis of 64 quantitative research papers (N = 4705) published between 2010 and 2018 in major journals. The main purpose of the study was to analyze the impact of AR on students’ learning gains. Furthermore, the study analyzed the influence of moderating variables such as control treatment, learning environment, learner type, and domain subject on the learning gains. The results identified that AR has a medium effect on the learning gains of students (d=.68,p<.001). Additionally, the study discusses the effect of AR on the moderating variables and establishes some possible routes of investigation for future work.}

abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) is gaining popularity in educational processes due to its recognized efficacy for teaching and learning. Many studies have identified the trends, advantages, opportunities, challenges, and impact of this technology on education. However, most of the previous studies failed to analyze the pedagogical approaches, somehow ignoring that the success of an intervention depends not only on the technical characteristics of the technology but also on the pedagogical strategies to implement them. This study presents a quantitative meta-analysis of 46 empirical studies to identify, in the light of the learning theories, how pedagogical approaches affect the impact of AR on education. In addition, we analyzed the impact of moderating variables on students' learning outcomes in AR interventions. The results indicate that the highest impact was obtained when interventions employed the collaborative pedagogical approach. Based on the findings of this study, we provide insights for researchers and practitioners on what characteristics of AR interventions seem to benefit students’ learning outcomes and how pedagogical approaches can be applied in various educational contexts, to guide the design of future AR interventions.}

In this study, a quasi-experimental design was used in which intact classrooms at two different schools, consisting of a total of one hundred 7th grade middle school students, were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. The experimental group completed the “Solar System and Beyond” module of their science course using AR technology, while the control group completed the same module using traditional methods and textbooks. Students in the experimental group were found to have higher levels of achievement and more positive attitudes towards the course than those in the control group. In addition, the results revealed that the students were pleased and wanted to continue using AR applications in the future. They also showed no signs of anxiety when using AR applications. In addition, it was found that academic achievements and attitudes of the students in the experimental group showed a positive, significant and intermediate correlation.}

An AR application for teaching structural systems, Virtual and Augmented Reality for Structures (VARS), is developed and tested using a quasi-experiment and a questionnaire. The study shows that VARS AR significantly improves the posttest quiz score of the experimental group. In addition, a conceptual framework linking design considerations and achievement of learning outcomes is created. Based on the questionnaire survey, authentic context and user interface are important design considerations influencing students’ perceived achievement of learning outcomes. It was found that experience using AR and background knowledge did not influence the perceived achievement of learning outcomes and change in quiz score.}

AR tools and environments lead to a variety of positive outcomes and impacts for educational purposes. Similarly, AR is changing the learning process in the Computer Science (CS) Education domain. There are numerous studies that adopt the immersive AR technology in order to improve Computational Thinking (CT) or programming skills, in several contexts. However, there are not sufficient studies that analyze the meaningful characteristics or the advantages and disadvantages of AR in the field. In order to better understand the impact of AR in programming education we performed a systematic literature review. This review analyzes 31 studies in the field. It explores the evolution of this developing technology, the challenges and issues that AR offers and discusses how this work can benefit student learning and further research.}
