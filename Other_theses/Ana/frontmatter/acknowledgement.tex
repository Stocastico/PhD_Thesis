First of all I would like to thank my supervisors Alberto Lafuente and Mikel Zorrilla. I have learnt a lot during these three years. Alberto, thank you for your guidance, your endless involvement, and for giving attention to every detail from the beginning to the end of the Ph.D. process. Mikel, thank you for trusting me since the very beginning, for all your support and advice and for managing the times when necessary. And thank you Julián Flórez for your time and advices, specially at the beginning of the process.

I would also like to thank all my colleagues in Vicomtech, particularly those involved in one way or another in this work. Iñigo Tamayo, thank you for your priceless technical knowledge. I would not be here without your incredible work during these years. Stefano Masneri, thank you for your willingness to help me at any moment with any task. I hope I can help in your Ph.D. as much as you did in mine. Angel Martín, thank you for sharing all the valuable information during your Ph.D. process. Iñaki Arruabarrena, thank you for just listening on those countless commuting trips and sharing your always important point of view. And I cannot forget the remaining colleagues of the department Felipe, Roberto, Alvaro, Javi, Iñigo, Miguel and the neighbour girls Amaia and Noelia, thank you for your encouragement which has been indispensable to finish the Ph.D.

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to Vicomtech. Thank you to the management team and to my director of department, I really appreciate the given opportunity to carry out my research in such a great environment.
