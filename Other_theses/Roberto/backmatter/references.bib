abstract = {Video-on-demand over IP (VOD) is one of the best-known examples of "next-generation" Internet applications cited as a goal by networking and multimedia researchers. Without empirical data, researchers have generally relied on simulated models to drive their design and developmental efforts. In this paper, we present one of the first measurement studies of a large VOD system, using data covering 219 days and more than 150,000 users in a VOD system deployed by China Telecom. Our study focuses on user behavior, content access patterns, and their implications on the design of multimedia streaming systems. Our results also show that when used to model the user-arrival rate, the traditional Poisson model is conservative and overestimates the probability of large arrival groups. We introduce a modified Poisson distribution that more accurately models our observations. We also observe a surprising result, that video session lengths has a weak inverse correlation with the video's popularity. Finally, we gain better understanding of the sources of video popularity through analysis of a number of internal and external factors.},

abstract = {IPTV services deployed nowadays often consist of both live TV and Video-on-Demand (VoD), offered by the same service provider to the same pool of users over the same managed network. Understanding user behaviors in such a setting is hence an important step for system modelling and optimization. Previous studies on user behavior on video services were on either live TV or VoD. For the first time, we conduct an in-depth large-scale behavior study for IPTV users offering simultaneously live TV and VoD choices at the same time. Our data is from the largest IPTV service provider in China, offering hundreds of live channels and hundreds of thousands of VoD files, with traces covering more than 1.9 million users over a period of 5 months. This large dataset provides us a unique opportunity to cross-compare user viewing behaviors for these services on the same platform, and sheds valuable insights on how users interact with such a simultaneous system.Our results lead to new understanding on IPTV user behaviors which have strong implications on system design. For example, we find that the average holding time for VoD is significantly longer than live TV. live TV users tend to surf more. However, if such channel surfing is discounted, the holding times of both services are not much different. While users in VoD tend to view HD longer, channel popularity for live TV is much less dependent on its video quality. In contrast to some popular assumptions on user interactivity, the transitions among live TV, VoD, and offline modes are far from a Markov model.},

	abstract = {Mobile devices have promoted users' mobility; therefore, there is a necessity to provide services that accomplish users' requirements at any place and time. With this, location becomes a key aspect of providing the dynamism required by solutions like the provisioning of reasonable mobile services by service provider networks. In that sense, the SDN paradigm arose to evolve from current static networks, which are manually configured by administrators, toward dynamic networks able to manage on their own at runtime and on demand. Solutions managing the SDN resources by using policies have been proposed, but they do not consider one of the main aspects to network dynamism: mobility. This article presents a mobility-aware and policy-based on-demand control network solution oriented to the SDN paradigm. This is in charge of managing, at runtime, the service and/or system state with high-level policies, which consider the mobility of users and services, the network statistics, and the infrastructure location. In this context, we define different use cases with the concerns of end users when they are in very crowded places, and the solutions provided by our solution through policies: balancing the network traffic between the infrastructure located close to the overloaded one; creating or dismantling geolocated virtual network infrastructure when the existing one is not enough, or is misused to meet end-user demands; and restricting specific network traffic in critical scenarios, like in sports events where crowds consume services with large bandwidth.},

The H2020 5GCity project aims to provide a solution for such issues by designing, developing, and deploying a sliceable, distributed cloud/edge and radio platform with neutral hosting capability to support the sharing between information technology infrastructure owners and media service providers (i.e., vertical media actors). In this paper, we initially introduce the essential benefits of the 5GCity technology and neutral host model to facilitate the rise of highly demanding media use cases (UCs) and its implication on how service providers typically operate (in terms of business model). Then, we show how the 5GCity architecture and infrastructure, in light of certain key performance indicators, address this demand through three media UCs (namely related to “video acquisition and production at the edge,” “immersive services,” and “mobile production and transmission”) and we explain how they are implemented and deployed in real citywide pilots (in Bristol, Lucca, and Barcelona) to demonstrate the benefits for infrastructure owners and media service providers.},

However, SD-RAN so far remained limited to a mere reconfiguration of the base station. In this work, we demonstrate a prototype of a service-oriented RAN on top of the OpenAirInterface and Mosaic5G platforms that brings programmability and extensibility to the RAN with a range of network applications for the purpose of intelligent slicing. We implemented a slice control and management framework, and plug a traffic analysis application that significantly improves the performance of slice users. We observe an improvement of 30\% in application round-trip time with negligible variability for the considered traffic.

One of the main challenges in those environments is to verify that the deployed functions and services operate correctly and meet the quality goals set by the stakeholders before they are put into production. We tackle this challenge by introducing the novel concept of a verification and validation (V\&V) platform for NFV, which enables automatic testing and qualification of single network functions and complex services. By adding such a platform to the NFV ecosystem, new business models emerge, as we discuss in this article.

A new wave of cloud-native PaaS promises to further improve SDN/NFV performance, portability, and cost-efficiency. In this poster, we highlight a work in progress being done in the 5G-MEDIA project [2], which pioneers the application of the serverless paradigm to NFV in the context of media intensive applications in 5G networks. Motivational use cases include tele-immersive gaming, mobile journalism and UHD content distribution. For example, consider a next-gen e-sport, in which bouts between gamers last only a few minutes. FaaS offers a clear cost-efficiency benefit for hosting such applications. An architecture is shown in Fig. 1. It includes i) an Application/Service Development Kit (SDK) to enable access to media applications development tools; ii) a Service Virtualization Platform (SVP) to run the ETSI MANO framework, the Media Service MAPE optimization component and the VIM and WIM plugins to enable NFVIs integration; iii) different NFVIs to execute media-specific VNFs. FaaS VIM is implemented for integration of FaaS with the rest of the MANO stack. It allows mixing FaaS and "regular" VNFs within the same media forwarding graph. For reference implementation, Apache OpenWhisk [1] and Kubernetes are used. The main challenge is extending the programming model to support groups of actions communicating over a network, while retaining the simplicity of FaaS. The project is supported by EU H2020 R\&I program (Grant Agreement No 761699).},

	abstract = {The focus of research into 5G networks to date has been largely on the required advances in network architectures, technologies, and infrastructures. Less effort has been put on the applications and services that will make use of and exploit the flexibility of 5G networks built upon the concept of software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). Media-based applications are amongst the most demanding services, requiring large bandwidths for high audio-visual quality, low-latency for interactivity, and sufficient infrastructure resources to deliver the computational power for running the media applications in the networked cloud. This paper presents a novel service virtualization platform (SVP), called 5G-MEDIA SVP, which leverages the principles of NFV and SDN to facilitate the development, deployment, and operation of media services on 5G networks. The platform offers an advanced cognitive management environment for the provisioning of network services (NSs) and media-related applications, which directly link their lifecycle management with user experience as well as optimization of infrastructure resource utilization. Another innovation of 5G-MEDIA SVP is the integration of serverless computing with media intensive applications in 5G networks, increasing cost effectiveness of operation and simplifying development and deployment time. The proposed SVP is being validated against three media use cases: 1) immersive virtual reality 3-D gaming application; 2) remote production of broadcast content incorporating user generated contents; and 3) dynamically adaptive content distribution networks for the intelligent distribution of ultrahigh definition content. The preliminary results of the 5G-MEDIA SVP platform evaluation are compared against current practice and show that the proposed platform provides enhanced functionality for the operators and infrastructure owners, while ensuring better NS performance to service providers and end users.},

	abstract = {Ultra-dense networks (UDNs) are a natural deployment evolution for handling the tremendous traffic increase related to the emerging 5G services, especially in urban environments. However, the associated infrastructure cost may become prohibitive. The evolving paradigm of network slicing can tackle such a challenge while optimizing the network resource usage, enabling multi-tenancy and facilitating resource sharing and efficient service-oriented communications. Indeed, network slicing in UDN deployments can offer the desired degree of customization in not only vanilla radio access network (RAN) designs, but also in the case of disaggregated multi-service RANs. In this article, we devise a novel multi-service RAN environment, RAN runtime, capable of supporting slice orchestration procedures and enabling flexible customization of slices as per tenant needs. Each network slice can exploit a number of services, which can be either dedicated or shared between multiple slices over a common RAN. The novel architecture we present concentrates on the orchestration and management systems. It interacts with the RAN modules, through the RAN runtime, via a number of new interfaces enabling a customized dedicated orchestration logic for each slice. We present results for a disaggregated UDN deployment where the RAN runtime is used to support slice-based multi-service chain creation and chain placement, with an auto-scaling mechanism to increase the performance.},

	abstract = {The future Internet is expected to connect billions of people, things and services having the potential to deliver a new set of applications by deriving new insights from the data generated from these diverse data sources. This highly interconnected global network brings new types of challenges in analysing and making sense of data. This is why machine learning is expected to be a crucial technology in the future, in making sense of data, in improving business and decision making, and in doing so, providing the potential to solve a wide range of problems in health care, telecommunications, urban computing, and others. Machine learning algorithms can learn how to perform certain tasks by generalizing examples from a range of sampling. This is a totally different paradigm than traditional programming language approaches, which are based on writing programs that process data to produce an output. However, choosing a suitable machine learning algorithm for a particular application requires a substantial amount of time and effort that is hard to undertake even with excellent research papers and textbooks. In order to reduce the time and effort, this paper introduces the TCDC (train, compare, decide, and change) approach, which can be thought as a ‘Machine Learning as a Service’ approach, to aid machine learning researchers and practitioners to choose the optimum machine learning model to use for achieving the best trade-off between accuracy and interpretability, computational complexity, and ease of implementation. The paper includes the results of testing and evaluating the recommenders based on the TCDC approach (in comparison with the traditional default approach) applied to 12 datasets that are available as open-source datasets drawn from diverse domains including health care, agriculture, aerodynamics and others. Our results indicate that the proposed approach selects the best model in terms of predictive accuracy in 62.5 \% for regression tests performed and 75 \% for classification tests.},

	abstract = {Fifth generation (5G) cellular networks will serve a wide variety of heterogeneous use cases, including mobile broadband users, ultra-low latency services and massively dense connectivity scenarios. The resulting diverse communication requirements will demand networking with unprecedented flexibility, not currently provided by the monolithic black-box approach of 4G cellular networks. The research community and an increasing number of standardization bodies and industry coalitions have recognized softwarization, virtualization, and disaggregation of networking functionalities as the key enablers of the needed shift to flexibility. Particularly, software-defined cellular networks are heralded as the prime technology to satisfy the new application-driven traffic requirements and to support the highly time-varying topology and interference dynamics, because of their openness through well-defined interfaces, and programmability, for swift and responsive network optimization. Leading the technological innovation in this direction, several 5G software-based projects and alliances have embraced the open source approach, making new libraries and frameworks available to the wireless community. This race to open source softwarization, however, has led to a deluge of solutions whose interoperability and interactions are often unclear. This article provides the first cohesive and exhaustive compendium of recent open source software and frameworks for 5G cellular networks, with a full stack and end-to-end perspective. We detail their capabilities and functionalities focusing on how their constituting elements fit the 5G ecosystem, and unravel the interactions among the surveyed solutions. Finally, we review hardware and testbeds on which these frameworks can run, and provide a critical perspective on the limitations of the state-of-the-art, as well as feasible directions toward fully open source, programmable 5G networks.}

It achieves complete virtualization and programmability vertically, and benefits the convergence of heterogeneous network horizontally.
