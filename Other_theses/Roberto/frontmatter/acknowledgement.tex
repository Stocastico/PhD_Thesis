It has been more than five years since I joined Vicomtech for my first work experience, when I was still a master's student, and three years since I started this Ph.D. process. I would like to thank all the great people who have enriched and supported me during this period.

First of all, I would like to thank my Ph.D. supervisors Jon Montalb\'an and \'Angel Mart\'in, my Ph.D. tutor Pablo Angueira, and Mikel Zorrilla, who was my supervisor during the first phase and still supported me throughout the Ph.D. process. Their guidance and support were essential to properly develop the research activity, including the description of the research ideas, the management of projects and the preparation of publications.

I would also like to thank my colleagues at Vicomtech, especially those in the Digital Media and Communications department. \'Angel Mart\'in, thank you for your invaluable help throughout the Ph.D process, from reviewing the state of the art to developing the experiments and writing publications; Mikel Zorrilla, thank you for giving me the opportunity to participate in interesting and challenging projects; Felipe Mogoll\'on, thank you for helping me in different projects and for always providing a solution for any problem encountered, even when dealing with unknown or new technologies you always ready to face it and provide your help; Ana Dom\'inguez, thank you for sharing information about Vicomtech and Ph.D. procedures and for lots of conversations during the coffee break; \'Alvaro Gabilondo, thank you for your positive mood (ya no queda nada..., ya queda menos...) and for many padel matches after work, even if I am still waiting for a bike ride.

I also thank my new colleagues, recently arrived in Vicomtech to enrich the 5G research line, Juncal, Zaloa, Mikel S. and Danilo, and the rest of the department, IÃ±igo, Stefano, Miguel Sergio and Hector.

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to Vicomtech for providing me with a great environment to carry out my research and create this Ph.D. dissertation. Thank you to management, Juli\'an Fl\'orez, Jorge Posada and Edurne Loyarte, and to my director of department, Mikel Zorrilla, for helping me as much as necessary.
